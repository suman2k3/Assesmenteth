Token Smart Contract
This Solidity smart contract implements a basic token system on the Ethereum blockchain. Below is an explanation of the contract's functionality and code structure.

Overview
The Token contract allows for the creation and management of a simple token. It includes functions to mint new tokens, burn existing tokens, and track the balances of different addresses.

Solidity Version
solidity
Copy code
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
This specifies the Solidity compiler version to be used, ensuring compatibility and preventing issues that might arise from using different compiler versions.

Contract Definition
solidity
Copy code
contract Token {
This line declares the beginning of the Token contract.

State Variables
solidity
Copy code
   string public nametoken = "etherium";
   string public token_Abbrev = "eth";
   uint public total_supply = 0;
 
   mapping(address => uint) public balance;
nametoken: A public string variable that holds the name of the token, which is "etherium".
token_Abbrev: A public string variable that holds the abbreviation of the token, which is "eth".
total_supply: A public unsigned integer that tracks the total supply of the token.
balance: A public mapping that associates each address with its token balance.
Functions
Mint Function
solidity
Copy code
   function mint(address addre, uint value) public {
      total_supply += value;
      balance[addre] += value;
   }
The mint function increases the total supply of the token and credits the specified address with the minted tokens.

addre: The address to which the minted tokens will be credited.
value: The amount of tokens to mint.
Burn Function
solidity
Copy code
    function burn(address addre, uint value) public {
      if (balance[addre] >= value) {
         total_supply -= value;
         balance[addre] -= value;
      }
    }
The burn function decreases the total supply of the token and deducts the specified amount of tokens from the given address, provided that the address has enough tokens.

addre: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
value: The amount of tokens to burn.
Summary
This contract provides a basic framework for creating and managing a token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functionalities to mint new tokens, burn existing tokens, and keep track of token balances for different addresses. The simplicity of this contract makes it a good starting point for learning about token contracts in Solidity.

Functions
Mint
solidity
Copy code
   function mint(address addre, uint value) public {
      total_supply += value;
      balance[addre] += value;
   }
Increases total supply and credits tokens to a specified address.

Burn
solidity
Copy code
   function burn(address addre, uint value) public {
      if (balance[addre] >= value) {
         total_supply -= value;
         balance[addre] -= value;
      }
   }
Decreases total supply and deducts tokens from a specified address, if the balance is sufficient.

Summary
This contract provides basic functionalities to manage a token: minting, burning, and tracking balances.
